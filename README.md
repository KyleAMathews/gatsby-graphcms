# gatsby-graphql-source example with GraphCMS

Simple gatsby site that displays blog with data inside GraphCMS.

[See it here](https://gatsby-graphcms-blog.netlify.com/)

## How it works

Using `gatsby-source-graphql`, this stitches schema from GraphCMS into Gatsby schema. All blog posts are retrieved in `gatsby-node` and pages are created for them.
